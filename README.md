My personal programming portfolio. Built in NextJs. I have been learning framer motion, so I used it for the animations. I used emailjs in the contact component. I wanted to incorporate responsive design, the menu will display as a hamburger menu on mobile and a top nav bar on larger screens. I also used an approach that easily allows "scaling up" as I add skills and projects. The site is hosted on vercel here: https://james-barbour.vercel.app/
